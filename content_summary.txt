*Coaching Definition
 “Coaching is unlocking a person’s potential to maximize their own performance. It is helping them to learn rather than teaching them.”: Sir John Whitmore

*Coaching
Coaching is already well connected to the work your staff is doing with families. It supports a child-centered, family-focused approach.
SAY:
 • Coaching is already well connected to the work your staff are doing with families – it supports a child-centered, family focused approach. 
 • You will see that many of the skills are the same as the motivational interviewing skills. 
 • You will hear us emphasize more than once about the parallel process 
 • If staff members are encouraged to be self-reflective and the focus is on their strengths, the hope is that they will do the same with their families. That way we establish a coaching culture throughout ACS and affiliated agencies.

*Coaching Approach
Utilizing a Coaching Approach means:
 • Asking more questions and giving less direction
 • Focusing on strength and skill development over time, in addition to day to day instruction and oversight
 • Offering more affirming, grounded assessment and feedback, with the intention of strengthening skills
 • Using language of commitment and holding team members accountable
 • Seeking feedback from team members on how to be more effective in all interactions
 • Consciously modeling strengths-based leadership at all times

*Coaching Mindset
 • Helps us see our assumptions and mental models so we can choose how we respond to situations.
 • Believes people have the resources to solve many of the challenges they face.
 • Supports people in accessing the resources they already have.
 • Creates a partnership for learning and change.
 • Uses questions to help people look for answers in unexpected places.
 • Checks power imbalances that exist in the coach-coachee relationship.
 SAY:
 • As we talk about the coaching mindset, keep in mind that it’s all about how we approach one another.
 • One of the key points is that we are NOT viewing people as broken or as needing to be “fixed.” 
 • In the same way that we want our staff to view and treat families as capable and whole human beings, we want to treat our coachees and our team members as whole and capable human beings. 
 • Mindset is essential to be effective as a coach and as a supervisor using coaching skills. 
 • At the heart of coaching is a willingness to set aside your own ideas about the best/right way to do something and to ask questions to hear someone else’s ideas about how to approach it. 
 • An effective coach will utilize questions that are influential but NOT directive. They use questions to help people step outside the problem mindset and look for answers in unexpected places. 
 • Asking questions allows the coachee to come up with their own ideas (even if it’s the same idea you had in mind), which gives a much better sense of ownership and commitment when they put it into practice. 
 • The focus should be on the future more than the past and finding new options rather than staying stuck. This is similar to your staff working with families using strengths-based engagement techniques and motivational interviewing.


*What Supervisors are Saying
 “Traditionally, as supervisors we have tried to ‘fix the problem’ With coaching, we support our staff to come up with solutions themselves.”
 “Coaching is about helping people learn.”
 “Workers become more self-sufficient and ultimately are able to help families learn to become self-sufficient.”
 “You can use coaching strategies ‘anytime,’ not just in formal supervision.”
 “Coaching is not dictating to staff but working collaboratively.”


*What do Supervisors Work on in Coaching?
 • Issues related to case planning and resident issues in detention
 • Identifying and addressing strengths and performance gaps
 • Decreasing feelings of overwhelm, stress, anxiety
 • Challenging working relationships
 • Breaking old patterns
 • Shifting priorities, facing challenges
 • Dealing more effectively with change
 • Determining next steps

*Coaching is...
 • Proactive: In order to stay ahead of problems
 • Performance enhancing: In order to improve employee performance
 • Strengths building: In order to maximize and reinforce the employee’s strengths
 • Support for making changes: In order to encourage productive change
 SAY:
 It IS proactive, enhancing performance goals and strengths. 
 • It provides support for making necessary changes. 
 • It’s also a paradigm shift, a different way of working than we have done before. 
 • Remind participants that Coaching is not intended for use as a remedial or disciplinary action. 
 • Some of you may have seen personnel policies that reference “coaching” employees when there are performance problems. 
 • The type of coaching we are describing has a more proactive approach. 
 • In this model, coaching helps the coachee identify performance goals, enhance strengths, and receive support for making necessary changes, hopefully preventing the need for corrective or disciplinary steps. 
 • Coaching in this context is intended as a strengths-based process.

*Coaching Can Take Many Forms
 • Supervision:  Integrating coaching into supervision promotes a parallel process between how supervisors work the staff ad how staff works with families.
 • Implementation:  Coaching creates a culture where staff are safe to take risks as they implement new practices
 • Transfer of learning:  Only when coaching is provided is it reasonable to expect that staff members will be able to adapt and master new strategies learned in training, enhance performance and develop deeper levels of critical thinking.
 • Coaching allies to all the work you do!

*What is Cultural Humility?
 • Knowledge of different cultures, assumptions and practices
  • Not assuming all members of a culture conform to a stereotype; each person remains an individual and is treated as such
  • An awareness of our personal assumptions and biases as we encounter others
 A key element of supervising and the Coaching mindset is recognizing the importance of being culturally humble.
 Cultural humility is an alternative approach to cultural competency, which you are already familiar with.
 Cultural humility means not pigeon-holing people – understanding that every person is an expert on their own culture. We could never be the expert on someone else’s culture.
 Just like we ask our staff to explore their client’s worldview, we must explore and understand the worldview of our staff.
 We can only ask questions to seek understanding. This is parallel to the Coach approach.
 Each of our staff will approach their professional roles differently as a result of their unique experiences.
 Knowledge of different cultures and their assumptions and practices is indeed important, but it can only go so far.
 Rather than assuming that all members of a culture conform to a certain stereotype, a child welfare staff with cultural humility will understand that while cultural differences will affect their interaction with individuals, each person remains a unique individual and should be treated as such.

*Cultural Humility Promotes…
 • Mutual respect and partnership between supervisors and staff
 • Checking power imbalances that exist in the coach-coachee relationship
 • Continuous engagement in self-reflection and self-critique as lifelong learners and reflective coaches

*Building a Trusting Relationship
 Trust is essential to keeping the coaching conversation real.
 Trust is established through:
 • Commitment to confidentiality
 • Clear mutual understanding of coaching and how coaching is part of the supervisory role
 • Modeling the coaching mindset and skills
 SAY:  
 Trust is essential in building a Coaching culture.
 Remember in supervision and in our work there are limits to confidentiality.
 It is essential for supervision to explain Coaching with their staff.
 Supervisees need to understand what Coaching is and how supervision will shift.
 Reminder, it takes time to build trust but not a lot of time to break it.

*How to be Present
 • What does it mean to be present?
 • What gets in the way of being present?
 • How is being present important?
 • What are ways of showing you are present?

*Guidelines for Engaged Listening
 • Put aside distractions
 • Be aware of internal thoughts
 • Stay focused on the person speaking
 • Hold off on forming your response
 • Use empathy, perspective, openness, and curiosity
 • Listen for what isn’t being said, watch non-verbals
 • Listen for the heart of the matter
 • Allow room for emotions and silence
 Point out the three types of not really listening;
 There are three common modes of NOT listening;
  •Self-referential – everything you say I connect to something about ME, so I talk more than you
  •Fix-it
  •Superficial
 One mode of listening is engage.

*How We Listen
 • 60% Through observing body language
 • 30% through the sound of the voice
 • 10% trhough the words spoken

*Reflecting & Clarifying
 Key elements:
 • Reflect back with the person’s words or paraphrase to ensure that you heard what they were saying and heard the intention/emotion behind the message
 • Clarify to ensure you can give an accurate restatement without over interpretation
 • Reflect the nuance of what you heard – what are you sensing behind the words?
 SAY:
 Here are some key elements of reflecting and clarifying
 Reflect back with the key words or paraphrase to ensure you heard what the other person was saying as well as hearing the intention/emotion behind the message.
 Clarify so that you give an accurate restatement without over interpretation.
 Reflect the nuance behind the words – what are you sensing?
 In the Motivational Interviewing program, there our four key skills your staff learn; open-ended questions, (which we’ll be getting to), affirmations, reflections and summaries – OARS. 
 By strengthening your reflection skills, you are also modeling and reinforcing these skills with your staff.

*Purpose of Reflecting & Clarifying
-Purpose of Reflecting
 • Conveys empathy and respect
 • Checks for accuracy of communication
 • Uncovers relevant information

-Purpose of Clarifying
 • Clears up vague or confusing messages
 • Confirms the Coachee’s understanding
 • Ensures that the Coach and the Coachee are on the “same page”

*Powerful Questions
 • Explore with intention once trust is built
 • Help to uncover insight to discover answers
 • Build greater buy-in from staff, commitment to the solution, and more independence
 • This is also how we want to work with clients and families
 SAY: 
 Questioning is our way of exploring with intention. You don’t necessarily know what the end result will be. 
 You ask questions you don’t know the answer to in order to allow the Coachee to uncover using their own insight and understanding.
 Staff will have greater buy-in and commitment to the solution, will become more independent, and discover they have many of the answers they seek.
 This is also how we want to work with clients and families.
 That is part of what motivational interviewing is all about, which many of your staff have or will be taking in Engagement and Motivational Interviewing.
 One of the four key skills they are learning in OARS is asking open-ended questions.

*Qualities of Powerful Questions
 • They are real questions, not advice in disguise
 • They come from sincere curiosity and respect
 • They are not leading to a particular outcome
 • They are open-ended and invite reflection
 • They often begin with “what” and “how”
 We do not drive the coachee to a “correct” or certain answer but openly explore possibilities with them.
 Remember that coaching is not used to display our own knowledge or expertise, but is used to strengthen the coachee’s personal experience, knowledge, and insight so they can be more effective with their clients.
 Focus on listening carefully and trust that the questions will come.


*Top 10 Asking Mistakes & Solutions
• Mistake 1: Closed Questions
 The most common mistake in coaching is asking too many closed questions. These can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no," shutting down further conversation.
 Examples of Closed Questions:
  "Is there a way to do that and still keep evenings for family?"
  "Can you realistically take that on too?"
  "Could there be any other ways to approach that?"
  "Do you have any other options?"
 Solution: Convert closed questions to open ones by rephrasing them using "what" or "how."
  "What could you do and still keep evenings for family?"
  "How would your life change if you take that on too?"
  "How else could you approach that?"
  "What other options do you have?"
• Mistake 2: Directive Questions
 Directive questions are disguised pieces of advice that limit the coachee’s ability to explore their own solutions.
 Examples of Directive Questions:
  "Shouldn’t you check in with your supervisor before you act on this?"
  "Could you do your jogging with your spouse?"
  "Can you give her the benefit of the doubt on this one?"
Solution: Follow Your Curiosity. Instead of directing, broaden the question to allow for multiple solutions.
 Instead of "Shouldn’t you check in with your supervisor?" ask:
 "What kind of channels do you need to go through before acting on this?"
 Instead of "Could you jog with your spouse?" ask:
 "How could you involve other people in your exercise routine?"

• Mistake 3: Seeking the “One True Question”
 Some coaches hesitate, searching for the perfect question that will "unlock" everything, causing long awkward pauses and losing conversational momentum.
 Solution: Trust the Process. Coaching is about helping the coachee think ahead, not about finding the perfect question. Simple follow-ups like:
  "Tell me more."
  "What else?"
  "Say more about that."
 Using the Observation and Question technique also helps:
 Repeat the most significant thing the coachee said and ask them to expand.
 Example: "You mentioned that X was frustrating. Tell me more about that."

• Mistake 4: Rambling Questions
 Some coaches struggle to keep their questions concise and end up asking multiple questions at once, making it hard for the coachee to respond.
 Solution: Think, Then Talk.
  Pause before speaking to formulate a clear, concise question.
  Allow silence—it often leads the coachee to keep processing the issue without needing another question.
  Ask the question once and stop talking to let the coachee lead.

• Mistake 5: Interpretive Questions
 Interpretive questions put assumptions into the conversation, often creating resistance from the coachee.
 Example of an Interpretive Question:
  A coachee says: “I’m frustrated with my project, not getting support, and keep looking at the clock.”
  Asking: “How long have you hated your job?” assumes they hate their job, which may not be the case.
 Solution: Use Their Own Words.
  Instead of assuming, ask:
  "How long have you been frustrated with your current project?"
  "What kind of support do you need that you aren’t getting?"
  "What triggers you looking at the clock and wishing the day was over?"

• Mistake 6: Rhetorical Questions
 Rhetorical questions are disguised judgments that can make coachees defensive.
 Examples of Rhetorical Questions:
  "What were you thinking!?"
  "Are you really going to throw away your career like that?"
  "Isn’t that just a cop-out?"
 Solution: Reset Your Attitude.
  Reflect on why you’re forming judgments. Ask yourself:
  "Could I be wrong about this situation?"
  "What potential do I see in this person?"
  Instead of judgmental questions, ask constructive ones:
  "What led to this decision?"
  "What options have you considered?"

• Mistake 7: Leading Questions
 Leading questions subtly push the coachee toward a preferred answer.
 Examples of Leading Questions:
  "How would you describe that feeling—discouraged?"
  "We’ve processed this for weeks—are you ready to decide now?"
  "It seems like option A gives quick results, but option B is better long-term. Which do you want?"
 Solution: Offer Multiple Options or the Opposite.
  Instead of: "Are you disappointed?"
  Ask: "Are you disappointed, excited, upset, or something else?"
  Instead of: "Will this take time away from family?"
  Add the opposite: "Or will this open up time for your family?"

• Mistake 8: Neglecting to Interrupt
 Some coachees talk for long periods, losing focus.
 Solution: Manage the Conversation.
  Politely refocus:
  "Let’s go back to what you mentioned earlier."
  "You express yourself well—can I interrupt occasionally to keep us on track?"

• Mistake 9: Interrupting Too Much
 Other coaches interrupt frequently, making coachees feel unheard.
 Solution: Count to Two Before Speaking.
  After the coachee stops speaking, count silently: "One, one-thousand, two, one-thousand."
  If they start speaking again, let them continue.
 Test if you're an interrupter:
 Record a session and note instances of:
 Interrupting – Speaking over the coachee.
 Talking Over – Continuing while the coachee tries to speak.
 Talking For – Finishing the coachee’s thoughts.

• Mistake 10: "Why" Questions
 "Why" questions often feel accusatory and make coachees defensive.
 Examples of "Why" Questions and Better Alternatives:
  "Why did you turn down the job?"
   → "What factors led to that decision?"
 "Why do you think she’d respond that way?"
  → "What makes you anticipate that response?"
 "Why can’t you talk to him about that?"
  → "What do you need to talk to him about that?"


*Feedback is
 • Strengths-based
 • Clear
 • Specific
 • Actionable
 • Constructive
 • Focused on behaviors
 • The purpose of feedback is to offer support.
 SAY:
 The main purpose of giving feedback is to offer support.  When you give feedback from a Coaching perspective:
 The intent of feedback is to help the Coachee be more successful
 Establish your role in giving the Coachee feedback up front
 Good feedback enables the Coachee to self-assess and provide their own feedback
 The Coachee should know that part of your role is also to hold them accountable for the agreements that they make with you

*Feedback Tips
 • Frequent: Frequent enough to sustain and timely to alter behavior
 • Well-timed: Aware of emotional readiness of receiver
 • Direct: Direct and related to a performance or behacvioral issue
 • Helpful: Receiver perceives the motives of giver as constructive
 • Behavioral: Direct discussion to changing behaviors, not personal values or beliefs
 • Clear: Make sure your feedback and intention are understood
 SAY: 
 As Coaches, one of our key opportunity is to strengthen the people we Coach by giving them appropriate, honest, sincere, and positive feedback and assessment.
 Praise is like water for plants – some people are cacti and don’t need much, others are ferns and need a lot. It’s not a flaw, it’s just what they need.
 The key is to balance both giving the right amount of feedback, not spending all your time with the person who needs constant feedback, and not ignoring the person who doesn’t have the same need for it.
 Feedback should be a balance of positive and developmental – 4 to 1 ratio – 4 positive things to 1 developmental
 Use inquiry wherever possible – “What went well, what did you learn and what will you do differently next time?”
 Give feedback that can be heard

*How the coach can elicit feedback on the coaching session.
1. Ask the Coachee what went well.
2. Give your specific feedback as to what went well from your perspective.
3. Ask the Coachee what he/she might do differently next time.
4. Give your developmental feedback to the Coachee.
5. Ask the Coachee what he/she would like to commit to going forward (as appropriate).

*Feedback Tips
 1. Frequent: Frequent enough to sustain and timely to alter behavior.
 2. Well-timed: Aware of emotional readiness of receiver and giver.
 3. Direct: Direct and related to a performance issue.
 4. Helpful: Receiver perceives the motives of giver as constructive.
 5. Behavioral: Direct discussion to changing behaviors, not personal values or beliefs.
 6. Clear: Make sure your feedback and intention are understood.

*Accountability
 “Being accountable simply means being responsible for decisions made, actions taken, and assignments completed.*”
  Source: Boundless. “The Importance of Accountability.” Boundless Management. Boundless, 21 Jul. 2015. Retrieved 08 Dec. 2015
 SAY:
 The sixth skill of Coaching is accountability.  Accountability and feedback are related -you gain commitment through feedback and hold the Coachee accountable.
 Being accountable simply means being responsible for decisions made, actions taken, and assignments completed.
 The Coach performs a real service to the Coachee by holding that person accountable for his/her commitments.
 Holding someone accountable means “I care about you and your success, I remember what you said you would do, and I am following up with you to track your progress.”
 The accountability shifts – you ask what they committed to versus telling them what they didn’t do.

*Keys to Holding Accountability
 • Clarity: What will you commit to? How will I hold you accountable?
 • Ownership: Staff/team member sees how it’s in his/her best interest to fulfill their commitment
 • Follow-up: Coach must follow up
    - Did you fulfill your commitment?
    - If not, what needs to happen for you to fulfill it?
 SAY:
 The language of commitment is powerful.
 There is a difference between “What are you going to do?” and “What will you commit to?”
 By using the language of commitment, Coach and Coachee both are clear on what the Coachee’s action items are, and it has the force of a declaration.
 People are more likely to do something if they commit to it.
