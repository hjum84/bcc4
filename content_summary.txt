Building Coaching Competency
“Coaching is unlocking a person’s potential to maximize their own performance. It is helping them to learn rather than teaching them.”

Sir John Whitmore
Coaching
Coaching is already well connected to the work your staff is doing with families. It supports a child-centered, family-focused approach.
You will see that many of the skills are the same as engagement or motivational interviewing skills.

“Coaching is about helping people learn.”
“Workers become more self-sufficient and ultimately are able to help families learn to become self-sufficient.”
